# Princess Conect: Grand Master Server Interface

This repo contain the grpc server and interface file for interact with Princess Connect: Grand Master client

# Is it works?
**Nope**, It's not contain any service logic, but it might work if you implement the logic (specifically battle logic)

## What it can do?
Maybe nothing, Just can communicate with client.

## How to run this
It contain 3 server (API, Matchmaking, BattleEngine)
You have to modify the Princess Connect: Grandmaster to connect to your server by yourself

## Did you plan to make it fully working?
Maybe not, The battle logic is contain on the server, but also in the client
While it possible to reverse engineering the client side logic, But it take too much afford to achieve it
